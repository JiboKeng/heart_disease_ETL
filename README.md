# heart_disease_ETL
This project provides a robust, modular Python pipeline for extracting and standardizing clinical heart disease data from multiple research sites (Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and VA Long Beach). The primary challenge addressed is the inconsistent data formatting across sites, where record lengths vary between 76 and 90 attributes, see README
